        | I realy don't like to write - but I need to document some stuff, even if it's just for me or my family. This is about the 7th iteration of IWICW theme. Can't remember all of them, but I've gone from roll your own to Jekyll then Octopress and back to Jekyll. This lastest version abandons Jekyll and uses a Rails Application with one simple model (Aritcle)

That results in posts in the Categories listed in the left sidebar and About stuff in the top menu bar."

          .callout.warning.fs09 Yes I play golf whenever I can. But then I've been managing golf group scores for about 30 years. Guess what I'm still doing? Think I'm on the 7th iteration of my web based management system.

            p Don't think I have any code or web sites in this area! But then most sites came from thinking.

      / p.m-3.p-2 I'm going to consentrate on the Rails work I've done in these areas over the last few years in this iteration. Then maybe I won't do anything - I don't have to!
      h4 Again, Enjoy!
