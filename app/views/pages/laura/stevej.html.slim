    h6.text-center Steve J Alex - Our Father

    p I have a few pictures of Steve. This one seems to be a graduation picture and Iâ€™m guessing about 1938. We got most of the information from a baptism certificate (I think) There you can see the name was Alexa and you can see to full Hungarian names. There is also a manifest when August came to the US. You can click on the images to get a full sizeimage
